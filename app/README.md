A bit about this organization.

This is a feature oriented organization.

It means that every feature has its own folder and if deleted, won't cause any trouble.

•components : all the visible elements, like buttons or cells that can be reused by other components.

•scenes : the scenes are all the "screens" that we see in our app, or all the pages like the login page or the home page, they are scenes.
Each scene contains its components (that can be used from the "component" folder)...

•services : can be used by the component or scene but does not use components nor scenes.
